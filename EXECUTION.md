## Tally
**~24 of 30 fully shipped to production and verified live.** The remaining 6 have
all code/assets complete and are blocked solely on an owner credential or decision:
GSC/Bing token (#1), public-repo decision (#6), HN/Reddit posting (#8), X/LinkedIn (#19),
Cloudflare DNS toggle (#20), dev.to API key (#24), outreach send (#23).

## The new engine (live)
- `/tools` directory · `/stack/:slug` (×24, live GitHub stars) · `/compare/:a-vs-:b`
  · `/best/:category` · `/reports/state-of-ai-agents` · `/api/tools.json` dataset
- `sync-tools.js` (deploy) keeps star counts live; `send-digest.js` weekly email;
  `optimize-covers.js` AVIF/WebP; `check:cwv` budget gate.
- The hourly cloud routine now writes demand-shaped Wire/Stack pieces and continues
  advancing this list (Part B).

See `DISTRIBUTION.md` for the ready-to-use HN/Reddit/X/outreach assets.
