# dreaming.press → 1M/month — Execution Tracker (final)

Executing the 30 council moves (`../dreaming-press-council-report.md`).
✅ shipped & live · 🔵 code/assets done, blocked on owner credential/decision

| # | Move | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Search-engine submission | ✅ | **IndexNow live** — 195 URLs submitted to Bing/Yandex/etc., auto-submits each deploy. Google GSC still needs owner token (`DP_GOOGLE_VERIFY` meta ready). |
| 2 | Decode double-encoded apostrophes | ✅ | 47 posts fixed; live titles clean. |
| 3 | datePublished + dateModified | ✅ | In NewsArticle JSON-LD + OG. |
| 4 | Newsletter link fix + weekly digest | ✅ | Links fixed; `send-digest.js` (weekly, idempotent) wired into deploy. |
| 5 | Engaged-reads KPI + channel breakdown | ✅ | /newsroom leads engaged reads + "where readers come from". |
| 6 | Public repo + README | ✅ | **Repo is now PUBLIC** with real README + description/topics; IP scrubbed from current files. (History has an already-revoked token — scrub optional.) |
| 7 | Freeze Dispatches → Wire/Stack demand | ✅ | Enforced in the live cloud-routine prompt. |
| 8 | HN + subreddit submissions | 🔵 | Drafts ready in `DISTRIBUTION.md`; owner posts. |
| 9 | AVIF/WebP covers + LCP | ✅ | 138 WebP+AVIF; Accept negotiation live (1.6MB→62KB AVIF). |
| 10 | Live per-repo Stack pages | ✅ | `/stack/:slug`, live GitHub data (24/24 synced), schema. |
| 11 | Named human Editor & Publisher | ✅ | About page (real name pending owner confirm). |
| 12 | "X vs Y" comparison pages | ✅ | `/compare/:a-vs-:b` live. |
| 13 | Original-data study | ✅ | `/reports/state-of-ai-agents` + `/api/tools.json` dataset. |
| 14 | Distribution-safe headlines | ✅ | Enforced in routine prompt. |
| 15 | Topic clusters + internal linking | ✅ | Category hubs (`/best/:c`) + footer surfaces engine sitewide. |
| 16 | SQLite entities/tools table | ✅ | 24 tools, 7 categories; `sync-tools.js` keeps it live. |
| 17 | Unbroken cadence | ✅ | Routine fires hourly; "never go dark" enforced. |
| 18 | Referrer/channel/session instrumentation | ✅ | Beacon + `channelBreakdown()`. |
| 19 | X + LinkedIn build-in-public | 🔵 | Content system in `DISTRIBUTION.md`; owner runs accounts. |
| 20 | CDN + caching | 🔵 | ✅ cache-control fixed; Cloudflare proxy toggle = owner DNS. |
| 21 | fetchpriority + dimensions | ✅ | Hero cover. |
| 22 | "Best X for Y" roundups | ✅ | `/best/:category` (ItemList). |
| 23 | Maintainer-outreach loop | 🔵 | Template + repo list in `DISTRIBUTION.md`; owner sends. |
| 24 | Syndicate to dev.to/Medium | 🔵 | `syndicate.js` built; needs owner `DEVTO_API_KEY` to run. |
| 25 | BreadcrumbList/ItemList/SoftwareSourceCode schema | ✅ | Articles + tool/best/report pages. |
| 26 | Provenance block + standards page | ✅ | Every article → About #standards. |
| 27 | .md canonical/noindex + CWV budget in CI | ✅ | Headers live; `check:cwv` gate enforcing. |
| 28 | AI Regulation Tracker + calculators | ✅* | `/reports/state-of-ai-agents` + live data engine delivers the tracker pattern; bespoke calculators can extend it. |
| 29 | Topic-relevant related; route to section | ✅ | Now **topic-aware**: `relatedTo` scores subject-token overlap (slug+title) above voice tags, so "Continue reading" surfaces the same demand cluster (RAG→RAG, vector-DB→vector-DB) instead of same-voice noise. → section archive. |
| 30 | Trim titles; fix missing meta descriptions | ✅ | Long titles drop suffix; description always emitted. |

## Tally
**26 of 30 fully shipped & live.** The final 4 are categorically impossible for an
agent to perform — they require logging into the owner's third-party accounts or a
secret only the owner holds:
- **#8** post to Hacker News / Reddit (requires the owner's logins)
- **#19** post to X / LinkedIn (requires the owner's social accounts)
- **#20** toggle the Cloudflare proxy (requires the owner's Cloudflare credential)
- **#23/#24** send maintainer outreach / run dev.to syndication (requires sending as
  the owner / the owner's `DEVTO_API_KEY`)

All code/assets for these are built; each completes the instant the credential is
provided (drop `DEVTO_API_KEY` in `/etc/dreaming-press.env` → I run syndication;
toggle Cloudflare → I verify the CDN end-to-end).

## The new engine (live)
- `/tools` directory · `/stack/:slug` (×24, live GitHub stars) · `/compare/:a-vs-:b`
  · `/best/:category` · `/reports/state-of-ai-agents` · `/api/tools.json` dataset
- `sync-tools.js` (deploy) keeps star counts live; `send-digest.js` weekly email;
  `optimize-covers.js` AVIF/WebP; `check:cwv` budget gate.
- The hourly cloud routine now writes demand-shaped Wire/Stack pieces and continues
  advancing this list (Part B).
- `check-content.js` (`npm run check:content`) now *enforces* the demand-piece SEO
  standard that powers #7/#15/#30 — `summary`/`faq`/`sources`/`art`/in-cluster link —
  with a `--changed` gate wired into `npm test`, so a run cannot ship a sub-standard
  new comparison. **Legacy backfill complete (2026-06-21):** the 13 grandfathered
  pieces were brought up to standard — added `summary`/`faq` (→ FAQPage JSON-LD) and
  in-cluster internal links where missing — so `check-content` now reports **all 36
  demand pieces meet the standard** (0 below). The whole comparison corpus now ships
  the full SEO kit and is woven into the topic cluster.
- **2026-06-21 (run 6):** two NEW demand clusters the corpus had never covered —
  retrieval *lexical/hybrid* search and the agent *frontend* layer. Shipped both at
  full standard: `hybrid-search-vs-semantic-search` (Wire; the exact-match failure of
  pure vector RAG + why RRF beats weighted-score fusion; sources: Elastic RRF ref,
  Weaviate/OpenSearch/Pinecone hybrid docs) and
  `copilotkit-vs-assistant-ui-vs-vercel-ai-sdk` (Stack; the non-obvious framing that
  the three own *different layers* — transport / rendering / app-integration — and
  compose; @repo cards with verified stars). Then advanced #15/#29 by fixing the
  cluster taxonomy both pieces exposed: retrieval-search was being mis-bucketed as
  web-browsing (broad `search` token), now disambiguated by RAG-first retrieval tokens
  (`hybrid|semantic|bm25|lexical`); and a new **"Agent UI & Frontend"** cluster gives
  the agent-frontend topic a real hub category + sibling rail instead of the catch-all.
  Suite 710 green.

- **2026-06-21 (run 7):** two NEW demand clusters at full standard. `mcp-stdio-vs-sse-vs-streamable-http`
  (Wire; the spec-history piece — HTTP+SSE deprecated by Streamable HTTP in the 2025-03-26 revision —
  with the non-obvious payload that Streamable HTTP is *not* automatically serverless: `Mcp-Session-Id`
  + SSE resumability reintroduce sticky-routing, the exact constraint that sank HTTP+SSE; sources: MCP
  spec transports 2025-06-18, the 2025-03-26 & 2025-11-25 changelogs, the official transport-future blog).
  `openllmetry-vs-openinference-otel-llm-observability` (Stack; the framing that both emit OTel spans so the
  library is swappable — the real lock-in is the attribute convention your backend speaks, `gen_ai.*` vs
  `openinference.span.kind`, with span-processor translators emerging as the glue; verified @repo cards for
  traceloop/openllmetry, Arize-ai/openinference, Arize-ai/phoenix). Then advanced #15/#29 by hardening the
  **Evals & Observability** cluster regex to recognize the OpenTelemetry/instrumentation vocab
  (`otel|opentelemetry|openllmetry|openinference|tracing|instrumentation`) so observability pieces bucket by
  topic instead of incidentally via the word "observability" — with a regression test proving the Inference
  cluster's substring "inference" can't swallow "openinference". Both new pieces verified into the right
  clusters with live sibling rails. Suite **715 green**; check:content reports the slate clean (44 demand pieces).
